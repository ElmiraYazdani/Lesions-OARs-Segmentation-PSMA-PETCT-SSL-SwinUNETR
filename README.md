# Segmentation-of-Lesions-and-Organs-at-Risk-on-PSMA-PET-CT-Images-Using-Self-Supervised-SWIN-UNTER
PSMA PET/CT imaging is widely used for image analysis of prostate cancer. We can seek unknown features by analyzing segmented parts. Since manual segmentation is labor-intensive, automated segmentation methods are preferred. The lack of annotated images makes DL segmentation models challenging. We developed Swin UNETR for automated segmentation.
